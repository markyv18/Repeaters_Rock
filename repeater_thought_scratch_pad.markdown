## Thing 1: Procedural stuffs

MVA - took me forever to figure out where to navigate to find anything and then keep it straight:

    1. where to find homework - http://backend.turing.io/module1/homework_assignments
    2. daily "what are we doing today/this week" - http://backend.turing.io/today/
    3. google cal for integration with your google cal - https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=casimircreative.com_59k8msrrc2ddhcv787vubvp0s4@group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America/Denver
    4. lectures - https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/tree/master/ruby_01-object_oriented_programming_with_ruby
    5. big repo of lecture slides (digging required) - https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B4C6lfVKu-E7Mlh0Z0FYbFA2YjQ
    6. mentor slide - https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B4C6lfVKu-E7Mlh0Z0FYbFA2YjQ
    7. Professional Development stuffs - https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/tree/master/module_one
